									<h2>Summary --- TL;DR</h2>


									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/conversations.png" alt="" /></span>

									<ul>
										<li>Non-native people have difficulty in speech communication.
										This is because the style of English speaking among people who have English as their second language is different, which makes them difficult to understand. </li>
										<li>ESL (English as a second language) speakers tend to follow the tone structure of their first language, making their speech difficult to understand for native speakers.</li>
										<li>Rather than focusing on important information in the speech, ESL speakers focus on parts of speech which do not convey intentionality.</li>
									<br>
									<br>

									For example, Hindi is a syllable-timed language and Hindi speaking people who have English as their second language (ESL), tend to speak English in a syllable-timed manner. English, however is supposed to be spoken in a stress-timed manner. This limits the opportunities for education and employment among ESL speakers.

									<br>
									<h3>English is spoken world-over in either of these two ways :</h3>

									<!-- We build an interactive smartphone-based educational mobile application using the user-centered design process. Through 4 iterative user testing phases, we discover 8 design parameters that are necessary for developing such an application. This application teaches English intonations based on globally consistent pitch patterns through conversations with a trained chat assistant, which inculcates expert linguists’ teaching principles. After co-designing the application’s parameters with primary stakeholders and expert visual designers, we assess its effectiveness by measuring the pre and post-performance of the users after the system usage, using various quantitative measures, like intonation scores, SEQ, and SUS. -->

									<h3>User testing on our mobile provides proof that our app helped in improving speech expressions of ESL speakers.</h3>
									<br>
									<ul>
									<li> Participants found significant improvement in the perception and articulation of their vocal expressions.</li>
									<li>Participants expressed the desire for the need of such an app in daily life which teaches "how, why and when" to speak, rather than "what".</li>

										<li>An initial literature review pointed us towards developing a mobile application that inculcates teaching 4 types of intonation expressing various intentionalities in speech. 
										<li>A cue-card study was conducted for confirm our hypothesis that teaching the 4 intonations found through literature survey in a conversational set-up would act as an effective structure to learn how to speak English.
										<li>A low-fidelity study was used for coming with the basic app structure, embedding necessary interactions that aide the learning process and finally, governing the app flow.</li>
										<li>An audio-visual user study revealed the most intuitive way to represent stress in written English. This was also one of our key contributions in the study.</li>

									<h3 style="color: #9c0000;"><b>Why</b> - We wanted to find out what kinds of techniques native speakers use to embed intentionality and expressiveness in speech.</h3>
									<h3 style="color:#b48648;"><b>How</b> - Along with discovering other paralinguistic parameteres which have been used conventionally to embed stress in speech, like pitch, amplitude, silences, etc, we also discovered 4 intonations in English which are used to express pragmatic intentions in communicative expressions. These intonations are also taught in film schools to teach why, when and how to pronounce certain parts of speech.</h3>
									<h3 style="color:#355E3B;"><b>Outcome</b> - We use these 4 intonations as our prerequisite design requirement that are necessary to help people practice English speaking in an effective manner.</h3>
									<br>
									<!-- <p>Literature survey of linguistics revealed 4 intonations which are universally accepted across all types of English accents like Australian, British, American etc. and that have different contextual meanings. These intonations are taught in film schools and also in English teaching courses, however these courses do not present these intonations in the context of conversation.--> <p>Each of these intonation has a different type of shape in terms of its pronunciation and different place in the sentence where it is pronounced. We use these intonations as our content structure modeled in different contexts for practice to teach why, when and how to pronounce intonations.</p>

First was clear demarcation of the different app phases. This prompted us to include section wise distinctions of the various app phases, namely, instructions, pre training, training, post training and analysis phases, which were clearly mentioned through a splash screen in the app. Second was graphical representation of the analysis phase for a less cluttered and less cognitively-loaded mode of display, which initially was only textual. This was incorporated in the final app development through two types of graphs showing the progress made in terms of the individual intonations learned and the total change in performance score as compared from the pre-training phase. --><!-- </p></p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/more pics/interact (1) (1).jpg" alt="" /></span>Third was section wise feedbacks on the training screens within the training phase for reinforcing the learning process that improves intonations. This was included in the final smartphone app development through constant pop-up feedback interactions and feedback screens after each training screen. Fourth was cues on the interaction details in the training screens, with ways to display the minimum number of tries, bonus attempts and hints. The minimum number of tries and bonus attempts were incorporated in the final app through circular icons on the top right of each training screen with three different colors, red denoting the wrong attempt, green denoting the correct attempt and grey denoting the remaining attempts. Hints were denoted through a separate button on the bottom left of the screen denoting incremental hints with each try to successfully complete the training level trial. The final theme that emerged out of the user study was introducing each new intonation before the actual training session. This was incorporated through a splash screen at the beginning of each new introduced intonation. The low-fidelity study gave us five important feedbacks and helped us transfer the relevant design details to the final mobile-based app.</p> -->

									<h2 id="visual">Visual Representation Testing</h2>
									<h3 style="color: #9c0000;"><b>Why</b> - For displaying how the intonations in English language are supposed to be spoken, we wanted to find an intuitive textual design for representing pitch in user speech which would be embedded in our final mobile application.</h3>
									<h3 style="color:#b48648;"><b>How</b> - After consulting with a design expert, we came up with an exhaustive list of 12 visual representation designs by combining all possible permutations of --- highlighting a text (using italics, underline, bold, text color, background color) in a standard text editor, and highlighting rise and fall of pitch (using text size variation and line graphs). We tested these visual representation designs with 10 students in a visual design class.</h3>
									<h3 style="color:#355E3B;"><b>Outcome</b> - This helped us in coming up with another design requirement (R8) for representing audio information visually (which uses bold and text size variation) in the final mobile application.</h3>
									<br>

									
									<p>Although a universal agreement has been reached to represent all possible human speech sounds through International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), little consensus been has developed for the representation of stress or pitch modulation. The figure represents the various ways in which pitch has been represented textually historically. A) depicts the notation presented by James Rush, B) presents the notation given by Lieberman tracing the 10th harmonic of a spoken sentence, C) depicts notation presented by Crystal, D) presents the notation presented by Bolinger, and E) portrays the notation presented by Ladefoged.

									<h3><b>Design Requirements from Visual Representation Testing</b></h3>
									<br>
									<p>
									We developed 12 visual representations (as shown in the figure below) from the combination of the above parameters to represent the stress or emphasis in a sentence for a user to intonate. The 12 visual representations were given in a randomized order to 10 students of visual design along with their respective audio clips. They were then asked to rate the closeness of the audio recordings to each of the representations (on a scale of 1 to 10) and point out the mismatch between the two if any.

									<h3 style="color:#b48648;"><b>How</b> - We designed and built our mobile application on an iOS mobile platform. We used Google server for transcribing user audio and Praat software for extracting pitch. We designed our own algorithm at the backend to analyze pitch values of users in the mobile application.</h3>
									<h3 style="color:#355E3B;"><b>Outcome</b> - User testing of our application revealed more than average usability score (SUS - 82.3/100), "good" rating on user experience (UEQ) and various user insights validating our 8 design requirements.</h3>

									<h3>Training Phase</h3>
									The Training phase introduced all the 4 types of intonations to users through different teaching modules. The users are first given examples explaining how and when the intonations are used. Then users are given training screens where they eengage in a conversation with the Verbose chat agent. They are provided optimal visual representation hints for helping them practice "how" and "where" to intonate effectively. Finally, they are provided with a feedback screen where they are taught "why" they are trained to speak the way they did in the module.

									<h3>Analysis Phase</h3>
									The Analysis phase provides user feedback on all the individual Pre-Training and Post-Training modules recordings, each provided side by side, so that the user can compare their performace pre and post training. The Analysis phase provided possible sources of error of why the users might not have been able to get their intonations correct. Finally, the Analysis phase provides feedback on the overall scores achieved by the user.

									<h3> Mobile Application Testing</h3>
									<br>
									

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/DSC_3083_brighter.png" alt="" /></span>A comprehensive user evaluation of the mobile application across the 4 phases --- pre-training test, training, post-training test and analysis, revealed various quantitative and qualitative insights that helped us validate the effectiveness of our design requirements in teaching English intonations to ESL speakers for improving their speech expressions in terms of affording better communicative intentions. We conducted the study with each participant over 3 sessions, i.e., we conducted the study over 3 days to reveal longitudinal effects of learning.</p>

									<h3>SEQ (Single Ease Questionnaire)</h3>
									
									<br>
									A Single Ease Questionnaire (SEQ) was condcutedd uring session 1: one immediately after Pre-Training test, second after completing the Training, third after the Post-Training test and fourth after going through the Analysis section. The mean SEQ rating for the four phases --- Pre-Training, Training, Post-Training and Analysis section came out to be --- 6.06, 4.31, 5.12, and 6.25 (out of 7).
									<br>
									<br>
									Since users were made to learn about new intonations, and why, how, and where to apply them in the training section, it was expected for this section to have a higher cognitive load for the users as compared to the other sections. A 4.31 rating (somewhere between average and somewhat easy), therefore seems justifable.
									<br>
									<br>
									<br>

									<h3>UEQ (User Experience Questionnaire)</h3>
									<br>
									<p>A UEQ questionnaire revealed user reponses on features of the app involving attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation and novelty.

										</div>
									</div>
									
									<br>
									<br>
			
									<h3>SUS (System Usability Scale)</h3>
									<p>The SUS scores were used to find the app usability. Any score above 80.3 (out of 100) on the SUS scale is among the top 10 percentile and correlates to the adjective rating of good. The overall user-friendliness of our app was rated 82.3 (out of 100) on SUS. The score was much above the required average benchmark score on SUS, which is 68. These results proved the hypothesis of our app in teaching the requisite English speaking skills. Quantitative analysis of learning gain across different intonation and across sessions revealed each result was statistically significant. Further, the percentage incorrect performance of the users was used to find the level of difficulty of each intonation. To further validate our findings and ground them in reason, these numbers were assisted from our qualitative findings of semi structured interviews conducted after session3 of the study.</p>
									

									
									<br>
									<br>

									<h3>Qualitative Observations</h3>
									<p>Interviews revealed user insights that highlight certain aspects of the mobile application that they found helpful in improving speech expressions.

									<div style="width: 45%; float:left">

									<h3><b>Novelty of the system</b></h3>

									<blockquote>''I was unaware and didn’t think specifcally about stress (intonations) till now. I always thought more on clarity or time spent on a topic, rather than the stress in the pitch.''</blockquote>

									

									<h3><b>Gamification</b></h3>

									<blockquote>''The design of the training exercises was very effective in my opinion. The screens were very interactive, it almost became like a challenge not to enter in the Bonus section and get the intonation right in the given number of tries.''</blockquote>

									<h3><b>Visual Representation</b></h3>

									<blockquote>''...(the context) was easy to understand because of the changed characters (in the visual representation)''</blockquote>

									<h3><b>Conceptual Facts on Intonations</b></h3>


									<blockquote>''The introductory screen was very important as it introduced me with new conceptual knowledge, which made things relatively easy to understand when I had to perform in the exercises. Also, the feedback screen gave explanations that why depending on a particular question (context) asked by Verbose, the intonation of an answer for specifc words will change.''</blockquote>
			
									

									<!-- <h3>Use Cases</h3>

								
					
									<blockquote>''For UPSC (Civil Services examination) aspirants, it is necessary to clear the interview...So these people who are preparing, they use many methods (to improve English) and this defnitely could be one of them''</blockquote>
 -->
									</div>

									<div style="width: 45%; float:right">
									
									<h3><b>Effectiveness of teaching pedagogy</b></h3>

									<blockquote>''I guess it (the mobile application) provides hints towards the modulation of how you speak. If someone is talking really fast, or if someone doesn’t know what he or she is speaking, just by the modulation you can tell if that sentence is a question or a statement.''</blockquote>


									<h3><b>Gradual Increase in Difficulty</b></h3>

					
									<blockquote>''When the session fnishes, it seems like you have learned a lot. It is a lot of new things, but I think the content has been designed intelligently. I didn’t feel anytime that I have to learn a lot suddenly. It was a gradual process.''</blockquote>

									<h3><b>Utility of the Mobile Application</b></h3>

									
					
									<blockquote>''You can’t understand the formation of sentences in their (ESL speakers) speech, so you are in general confused (about context) what they are trying to stress on. At those moments you understand that it (context specifc stress words) matters...like some people intonate words like "the" and "it" , and it just makes the sentence confusing to interpret.''</blockquote>
			
									
					
									<blockquote>''It’s important because you want to convey the intention very clearly...my speech has improved. I am not a bland speaker anymore (laughs).''</blockquote>

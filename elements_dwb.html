										<h2><b>Questions addresses in this research</b></h2>
										<ul>
											<li><h3>Is binge-watching behavior a result of human guilty pleasures, or is it also infleunced by external factors?</h3></li>
											<li><h3>Could UI elements like Autoplay and Recommendations meant to provide viewing convenience, instead become uncontrollable and enforce mindless watching?</h3></li>
										</ul>
										</p>
									<!-- <p style="wcolor:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.55); font-size: 22px"> -->

										<h2><b>Findings</b></h2>

										<ul>

										<li><h3>Rather than deciding to stop watching, users keep video watching compulsively at various times, specifically when viewing for entertainment purposes.</h3></li>
										<li><h3>We find that certain UI elements on video streaming platforms are problematic that indirectly force us to watch more.</h3></li>
										<li><h3>These elements reduce user autonomy and sense of self control when video watching in long durations.</h3></li>
										</ul>

									<h2><b>TL;DR</b></h2>



									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/dp_fresh.png" alt="" /></span>

									<ul>
									<li><b>Dark Patterns --- </b>Dark patterns are deceptive UI elements that trick users into doing something that they didn't intend. Examples of a general category of dark patterns can be seen on the right (Gray et al. [1]). Previous studies have pointed various categories of UI dark patterns in a range of user engagement areas like social media viewing, shopping, gaming etc.</li><br>
									<br>



			
									<b>What we did</b>
									<li>In this study, we investigate dark patterns on famous video streaming platforms in India --- Youtube, Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar and PrimeVideo.</li>
									<li>We conduct a diary study analysis with 22 participants over a period of 20 days to find user moods and feeling while they watch videos.</li>
									<li>We then conduct follow-up interviews to reveal explanations behind user viewing trends</li>
									<li>We then individually analyze the 4 video streaming platforms and reveal dark pattern categories in them.
									<li>We finally highlight 4 UI elements that designers should consider implementing for sustainable and longer user retention rates.</li>

									<br>
									<br>

									<!-- We conduct a diary study with 22 viewers over 228 sessions to gain insight into users’ states of mind and to identify users’ emotions while interacting with 4 popular streaming platforms --- Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar and Youtube. We analyze users during two phases --- video selection phase and video completion phase. We analyze these phases at two temporal stages --- at the start of video watching session and at the end of it. We find out meaningful correlations between user mood and contextual behaviors that highlight how particular individual characteristics and viewing situations can lead to negative behaviors. Furthermore, we collect screenshots of problematic design UIs and find out the rationale behind the functioning of these UI elements on video streaming platforms, highlighting the psychological tricks that take away user autonomy and sense of self control. -->

									<b>Categories of dark pattern highlighted through our study</b>
									<!-- <li>We define and taxonomize 5 dark patterns specifically found on video streaming applications --- Feature Fog, Extreme Countdown, Switchoff Delay, Attention Quicksand and Bias Grind. Our study provides design critique of existing video streaming platforms and points out theoritical design considerations that can help safeguard user interests and enhance their sense of digital wellbeing.</li> -->
									</ul>

									<!-- <h3>Our study results point out that following dark patterns exist in current video streaming platforms' UI -</h3>

									<br>


								Binge-watching videos has become a social phenomena off late with the easy availability of high speed internet access and ubiquitous computing. Prior literature talks about the consequences of such an addictive habit, with side effects ranging from having feelings of guilt and regret to long-term psychological effects like anxiety and depression [2]. With the video content getting more and more compelling each day, season producers are releasing their episodes all at once for people to easily indulge in, making users prone to extended video watching. Literature readings of habit formation and addictive behaviors reveal how triggers of loneliness, boredom, fear of missing out, etc. cause users to engage in various online activities like video watching due to their attention capturing abilities [3]. This makes it a problemtaic vicious cycle of compulsive user behavior that gets embedded in the binge watchers' daily video watching routine.</p>

									<p>After conducting the intital exploratory survey, we decided to focus our efforts on finding habitual human behaviors, while using context and type of UI interaction used as prompts at various temporal satges of video watching. The study involved four stages.
									<ol>
										<li>An online diary study that revealed the patterns of state of mind and moods of users while interacting with UI of video streaming platforms.</li>
										<li>Interviews with participants based on a selected set of problematic artifacts to come up with a taxonomization of UI dark patterns in popular video streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar, PrimeVideo and Youtube.</li>
										<li>Formulation of theoritical design suggestions from existing literature and interview insights that can help in safeguarding unintended behaviors of compulsive viewing due to popular features like Autoplay and Recommendations.</li>

									<h3><b style="color: #009c9c;">Constraints</b> - Method (that can capture details of a user's video watching behavior with least disruption of their natural routine)</h3>
									
									<h3><b style="color:#004e9c;">Informed by</b> - Dual Process Theory (Habit formation theory), PANAS, SAM pictorial scale (user affect scales).</h3>

									<h3><b style="color: #009c4e">Why only diary study?</b> - We wanted to get insights on both, quantitative trends, as well qualitative insights on those trends.

Diary studies are easy and convenient to use, while also help to capture detailed information on user context.</h3>
									
									<br>

									<p>
									<!-- We initially thought of using physical probes that users can interact with at fixed times in a day to investigate user behavior and better acknowledge their context (place, time, social setting) for a period of two weeks. However, after discussions among team members, we decided to change this and rather a use a diary study to note user context as we wanted to note the user's state of mind and how they feel right after they finished their viewing session. --> 

									We requested users in the diary study to comment of the type of UI interaction they used, context, their feelings (satisfaction, regret, or somewhere in between) and state of mind (mindful, mindless, or somewhere in between) right after they finished a viewing session. 

									<!-- This was important as right after finishing a viewing session users are still fresh and remember their experience.  -->

									<!-- We used Dual Process Theory literature as our framework to investigate thinking patterns and user perceptions in video watching as it is intended to reveal both conscious (controlled, mindful) and unconscious (automatic, mindless) thinking patterns, as manifested in user viewing behaviors. -->

									<!-- After conducting the diary study, we observed that users had distinct behaviors at the start and end of viewing sessions, as well at the start and end of each video.<
									<br>
									<br>
									For that reason, we divided a video watching session into 2 phases --- "start of a video session" and "end of a video session".
									<br>
									<br>
									This further led us to analyze user watching behaviors at two temporal stages --- "video selection phase" and "video completion phase", both at the start and end of a viewing session.</h3>
									<br> -->
									<p>
									<ul>
									<li>We define a video watching session as the entire length of video watching duration in which the user finished their viewing with a maximum break of 10 minutes in between.</li>
									<li>We observed user behaviors at two stages in the viewing session--- <i>video selection (interaction) phase</i> and the <i>video completion phase</i>.</li>
									</ul>
									</p>


									<p><h3><b>Video Selection phase</b> - </h3>We refer to video selection phase as the phase where users interact with the UI streaming platform to select a video.


									<ul>
									<li>There's a 24.8% increase in mindless viewing from start to end of an session when users use Autoplay, as compared to 3.5% increase in mindless viewing due to Recommendations.</li>

									<h3><b style="color: #009c9c;">Constraints</b> - Guidelines (on what can be termed as problematic design, and what not)</h3>
									<h3><b style="color:#004e9c;">Informed by</b> - Pain points of users in the previous study.</h3>
									<h3><b style="color:#b48648;">Process</b> - Design analysis of problematic UI elements on 4 famous video streaming platforms --- Youtube, Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar, PrimeVideo across different devices (laptop/PC, mobile/tablet devices, television).</h3>
									<h3><b style="color: #009c4e">Why design analysis?</b> - We were a group of 5 researchers, with one among us who serves as an expert UX professional. Based on discussions among the group, we relied on our researching experiences to converge on the understanding of what might be termed as a problematic design, and what not.</h3>

									<h2 id="dark"><b>Dark Pattern Classification</b></h2>

									A dark pattern is defined as
									a user interface that has been carefully crafted to trick users
									into doing things. They are not mistakes, they are carefully
									crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and
									do not have the user’s interests in mind [2].
									<br>
									<br>
									<h3><b style="color: #9c0000;">Motivation</b> - Categorize problematic design elements into an appropriate taxonomy that reprresents dark patterns.</h3>

									<h3><b style="color: #009c9c;">Constraints</b> - Lack of an existing taxonomy (Ours is the first work that categorizes dark patterns on streaming platforms, hence we didn't have a previous taxonomy to derive our work from)</h3>

									<h3><b style="color:#004e9c;">Informed by</b> - Problematic design elements selected on 4 video streaming platforms through design analysis.</h3>

									<h3><b style="color:#b48648;">Process</b> - Group discussion among the 4 researchers regarding the vailidty of each category.</h3>

									<ul>
									<li>The goal of this categorization process was to reveal certain situations of use and their consequent effect on a user’s state of mind.</li>
									<li>For example, one category was ‘extreme countdown’ which not only represented the timer in an Autoplay functionality, but also the pressure situation induced by it for the users to make a decision.</li>
									<li>Similarly, "attention quicksand" not only pointed at the autoplay functionality of video trailers and GIFs on mouse hover, but also the tendency of mind to easily get distracted by them. </li>
									</ul>
									

									<!-- Following in the works of previous activists like Harry Brignull who coined the term dark patterns, we introduced a definition of dark patterns as seen from the perspective of long term behaviour in terms of video watching. We propose that while these features are useful, these features ought to have safeguard measures in long term from a user-centric design philosophy or they should be classified as dark. -->

									
									<h3><b style="color:#355E3B;">Outcome</b> - Formulation of dark patterns for video streaming platforms.</h3>

									<br>Following are the 5 categories -

														<th>Dark Pattern</th>
														<th>Description</th>

														<td>Feature fog</td>
														<td>UI patterns that induce unawareness by reducing autonomy of monitoring user time spent. These UI patterns are designed so that the user less able to get feedback on time spent engaged in a viewing session.</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														
														<td>Extreme countdown</td>
														<td>UI patterns that have a timer and that execute automatically if not interrupted within the short period of time. These patterns induce pressure situations, especially when present socially, to make a decision within the given time.</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														
														<td>Switchoff delay</td>
														<td>UI patterns that promote strategies of hiding restrictive usage features in the default UI. Such options prevent people from breaking mindless extended viewing patterns instantly.</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														
														<td>Attention quicksand</td>
														<td>UI patterns that instantly start without conscious user action. They instantly grab user attention and divert them from what could otherwise be a different online behavior.</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														
														<td>Bias grind</td>
														<td>UI patterns that disproportionately overload user interests and biases. Infinitely long scroll of Recommendations based on previous watching history, provide a choice overload, which is a phenomenon of presenting too many choices to users.</td>

									<h2 id="intvws"><b>Interviews</b></h2>
									
									<h3><b style="color: #9c0000;">Motivation</b> - Gather user insights on dark patterns and provide design suggestions for future research.</h3>
									<h3><b style="color: #009c9c;">Constraints</b> - Access (We weren't able to invite people for in-person interviews)</h3>
									<h3><b style="color:#004e9c;">Informed by</b> - 5 categories of dark patterns discovered in previous stage.</h3>
									<h3><b style="color:#b48648;">Process</b> - Interviews with 15 participants on 44 problematic instances of UI elements found on 4 famous video streaming platforms.</h3>
									<h3><b style="color: #009c4e">Why interviews?</b> - We wanted to get qualitative insights on our taxonomy of dark patterns. For the interviews, we initially thought of showing people dark patterns on lab PC and then asking them to use that UI. However due to access issues, we only showed the participants with screenshots of dark patterns and asked them to remember their prior experiences of using such a design element while video watching.</h3>
									<h3><b style="color:#355E3B;">Outcome</b> - Following are some examples of user excerpts on dark patterns -</h3>
									<br>

											<div style="width: 45%; float:left">
											<blockquote>''It’s easy to just click on any video and keep on watching. It’s not that you pay attention all the time, un- like reading a book. There is a responsibility of video platforms to provide content that helps avoid choice paralysis.''</blockquote>
											
											</div>

											<div style="width: 45%; float:right">
											<blockquote>''GIF previews on YouTube immediately capture my attention. On a laptop device, they get active whenever I hover my mouse over thumbnails. There’s hardly any space on the screen where I can place my cursor so that there is no animation. It is so annoying at times!''</blockquote>

							<p>Verisk provides data analytic insights to customers in insurance, energy and financial services to help them make better, faster, and more reliable decisions that minimize risk and maximize value.</br></br>
							I worked remotely as a software developer and data analyst at Verisk Innovative Analytics. I was primarily responsible for finding out parameter accuracy of the Q/A model of BERT deployed by the Automatic Speech Recognition Department. The task involved comparing data of the BERT model with manual labeling and then coming up with keywords that would increase the model accuracy. Further, I was responsible for maintaining the post-production deployment ready code by constantly running it on different datasets, optimizing it by conditioning domain specific keywords in the output to eliminate common model mistakes and finally, cleaning it by removing the unnecessary information in the output. My internship concluded with a presentation on research insights for the possibility of a deception detection model of speech that could be employed in the company for various possible use cases such as for call center employees etc. and the inherent barriers present in its implementation.</br>

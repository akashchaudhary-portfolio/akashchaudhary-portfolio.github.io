							<p>ILIAD Lab stands for Interdisciplinary Lab for Interactive AV Development. The name has been adopted from a Greek poem attributed to Homer. This is the creative and audio lab at IIIT-Delhi and I am a member of the team working under Dr Timothy Scott Moyers Jr. Dr Timothy(Tim) has a philosophical and innovative side to his personality and we usually have on the walk discussions with him regarding the universal patterns in music. We also get a taste of the different types of music(and noise) which are and have remained prevalent, and the great musicians that have flourished throughout history when we are with him. It's a lab for fun and creativity with no deadlines for any work. Everyone just loves the company of each other, and find themselves involved in work together. We build toolkits for people to enable creative capabilities.</p>
